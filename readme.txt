Running the Program: Within your IDE of choice, navigate to src/clueGame and run the ClueGame.java file.

Playing the Game: On each turn you will automatically roll a dice to move. Click a tile highlighted in white to move there. Then click the Next button to move to the next player's turn. The other players are controlled by AI and will move automatically. Keep pressing the Next button until it is your turn again. If you move into a room, a window will pop up and ask you to make a suggestion. Select a player and weapon to suggest. After that, the result of your suggestion will appear in box labeled GuessResult at the bottom right of the window, usually being a card that another player revealed to you. Your seen cards and cards in hand appear in the Known Cards column at the right of the window. Once you are ready to make an accusation, click the Make Accusation button at the bottom-middle of the window. Choose a room, player, and weapon to make your accusation. If your accusation is right, you win the game! If it is wrong then you lose.
